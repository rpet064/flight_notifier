# About
Enjoy travelling? Don't want to check flight prices every night? This is the programme for you.
All you need to do is to create your own Twilio & Tequila account and put the information in place of my environment variables.
The first time you run this programme it will ask for flight information - this is inputted into a CSV locally. 
After that the script can run without user input - make sure you change the name input into an assigned name varible (for example name = "Rob")

# Modules
This programme uses pandas, random, requests, countryinfo, datetime & twilio.rest.

# APIs
Twilio API & Tequila API (Kiwi.com) - You will need to create your own account

# Backend
Python - programme can be run using Python locally

# Bug fixes/upates
Please let me know if you find any bugs or have any suggestions
There are no scheduled updates - but this project is great to fork for other text notification/flight-search programmes.
